HTTP BATTLESHIP GAME
@AUTHORS Lane Lutgen and Chance Ronning Glenn
---------------------------------------------
1. HOW TO PLAY
---------------------------------------------
To start the game, run the server.py file from a
command prompt. Use the below format where 5000
is the port number and board.txt is the board 
to play with.

python server.py 5000 board.txt

Upon running server.py, the server will create
or overwrite two HTML files: own_board.html
and opponent_board.html.

To stop the game at any time, close the command
prompt running the server. NOTE: Next time you run
the server, both the PLAYER and the OPPONENT boards
will be reset.

To fire at the opponent. Run the following command:

python server.py <IP ADDRESS> 5000 <X COOR> <Y COOR>

The IP ADDRESS should be for your opponent's server, the 
X COOR and Y COOR placeholders are the coordinates to send to the
opponent's server. Note that client.py needs to be run
for every fire at the opponent. Every timethe client is invoked, 
it will update the opponent_board.html file with a HIT or a MISS.

Whenever the opponent fires at the player, the server will update the
own_board.html file with a HIT or a MISS based on the coordinates
sent.

NOTE: When testing on a single computer (Ex. IP ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1),
both the own_player.html and opponent.board.html files will be updated
since the player is playing his/herself.
-------------------------------------------------
2. VIEWING THE BOARDS
-------------------------------------------------
To view the HTML representations of the boards, either open up the 
own_board.html and the opponent_board.html files locally, or if the 
player server is running, they can be accessed in any browser with the
following URLs:

http://localhost:5000/own_board.html
http://localhost:5000/opponent_board.html

These URLs are handled by the server in a GET request handler.
-------------------------------------------------
3. MESSAGE FORMAT
-------------------------------------------------
Messages from client to opponent server are sent
in the following format: "x=0&y=1" where x is the
x coordinate and y is the y coordinate. (0 and
1 are used as examples). The HTTP message type used for 
coordinates is POST.

Response messages from opponent server to client are sent
in the following format and are handled in the POST request handler: 
"hit=1/0&sink=C/B/R/S/D/0"

Where...

1 = HIT
0 = MISS

C = CARRIER SUNK
B = BATTLESHIP SUNK
R = CRUISER SUNK
S = SUBMARINE SUNK
D = DESTROYER SUNK
0 = NO SHIPS WERE SUNK

RESPONSE CODES
200: Success
404: Coordinates out of bounds
400: Repeated call
